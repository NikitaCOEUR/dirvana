# Dirvana Completion Scripts Registry - Version 1
# This file can be updated independently from dirvana releases
# Community contributions welcome!

version: "1"
description: "Registry of bash completion scripts for tools without dynamic completion"

# Design Philosophy:
# - Dirvana executes ALL completion scripts via bash, regardless of user's shell
# - Scripts output simple text suggestions (value\tdescription format)
# - Each shell (bash/zsh) then formats suggestions using native completion system
# - This means: ONE bash script works for ALL shells (bash, zsh, fish)

# Only include tools that:
# - Have static bash completion scripts that can be downloaded
# - Do NOT have built-in dynamic completion (kubectl, helm, terraform, etc. are excluded)
# - Are commonly used and would benefit from completion support

tools:
  govc:
    description: "VMware vSphere CLI - govmomi"
    homepage: "https://github.com/vmware/govmomi"
    script:
      url: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vmware/govmomi/main/scripts/govc_bash_completion"
      sha256: null  # Optional: add checksum for security verification

  # Example for future additions:
  # tool-name:
  #   description: "Brief description of the tool"
  #   homepage: "https://github.com/..."
  #   script:
  #     url: "https://..."
  #     sha256: "abc123..."  # Optional checksum
